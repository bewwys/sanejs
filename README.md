The goal of this project is to experiment to develop a simple framework for frontend engineering. Sadly web development has achieve the worst state of development seen in the history of computer. We should keep in mind thoses guidelines:

	- Simple to use when possible.
	- Closest to what vanillajs can do in term of speed.
	- Memory footprint as small as an ant.
	- Responsive
	- Joy and fun
	- Waw effect
	- Benchmark for the worst case
	- No fucking deps

That's it for now.
